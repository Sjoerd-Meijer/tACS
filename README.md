# tACS-fMRI: analyses scripts

Scripts for analyses of behavioural and fMRI data obtained during a social approach-avoidance task. 

## Social approach-avoidance task
Control over emotional action tendencies was manipulated using a social approach-avoidance task. Participants had to respond by pulling or pushing a joystick. 

## Dual-site transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)
During the task, participants received dual-site theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupled transcranial alternating current stimulation over right prefrontal- and left sensorimotor cortex. Stimulation was delivered inter-leaved over blocks of 12 trials in-phase, anti-phase, or sham. 

## BOLD fMRI
Concurrently measured BOLD fMRI was used to explain inter-individual variation in the neural response to tACS in relation to the modulation of behavioural measures of emotional-action control.
